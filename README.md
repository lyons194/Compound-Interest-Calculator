Compound-Interest-Calculator

A compound interest calculator coded in Python.

This calculator allows the user to calculate the compound interest for any number of loans the user prefers, within one sitting.

When running the program, the user first specifies how many loans they will be calculating.

The program then inputs the principal, interest rate, time period (in years) and number of times per year that the interest compounds, for each loan they need to calculate.
