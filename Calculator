	Then, include an option in the beginning of the program that allows the user to specify
	how many annuities for which they need to calculate compound interest.  By having this 
	option in the program, it becomes easier for the user because the user will only have to
	answer prin, rate, time and number a certain amount of times.  Plus, the user won't have to
	mess with copying and pasting the program multiple times in order to calculate multiple
	annuities."""
